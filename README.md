# Voting System (Client)

Somehow works,don't ask how...

My final year project is a Online Voting System focuses on security and usability of both voter and election candidate.
This is the Client side app of voting system,with this android application ,you can:

#### functions
<a name="features"></a>
- Create a account
- Vote
- See results
- Change user credentials(except voters id)
- etc

We made this project simple and secure as much as possible as my limited knowledge.
If you have any suggestion regarding the project security ,design or anything... feel free to open an Issue [here](https://github.com/DeFerence3/VotingSystemClient/issues/new). I'm always a learner.
